1. So first we have to create data in js then collect all then render it to js.

2. What i have done till now as follows:
* We cloned the startup code for amazon project.

* We created a new directory in main directory as scripts for storing all javascripts files.

* We linked js file to its respective html i.e. amazone.js to amazon.html using script tag just above closing tag of body.

* We created a data structure using objects inside array where each object is for a product with their details.

* All object MUST follow the same datastructure.

* We ran a loop on the datastructure using forEach loop. Created html tamplets for each product by using placeholders inside the templet.

* Stored all values in a single string.

* Targeted the parent component of all products form html page using document.querySelector().

* Chaged the inner html of parent component to stored value using document.querySelector().innerHTML.

# For Formatting numbers we user .toFixed(n) method where n is the number of digits after decimel.
